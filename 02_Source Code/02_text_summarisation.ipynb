They mandate the notification of premises generating hazardous waste, codify the mixing prohibitions, and detail the documentation and record-keeping requirements for waste producers, carriers, and consignees.

The regulations also introduce stipulations for the separation of mixed hazardous wastes, specify notification periods for premises dealing with hazardous waste, and outline the conditions under which waste mixing is permitted.
